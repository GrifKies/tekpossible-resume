# Resume - Griffin Kiesecker
## Purpose
This is my resume. I created it to prove 2 things: 
1. I can write and maintain a web application via AWS DevOps principles.
2. I can use the CDK to deploy all infrastructure needed to deploy the CI/CD and NodeJS server infrastructure. I can also use a CI/CD pipeline to deploy any changes to the infrastructure
